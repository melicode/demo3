            <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain <br>
                was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings <br>
                of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, <br>
                or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue <br>
                pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who <br>
                loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally <br>
                circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, <br>
                which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who <br>
                has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, <br>
                or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
